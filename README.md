# EmployeesBDGifts
 Simple Web app that allows employees to vote for best presents for their colleagues birthdays
 
 In order to run create a database and replace the connection string.
 Then execute the file that is placed in (EmployeesBDGifts\Data\DbSchemeWithSeeds)
 towards that database. Or execute all of the db migrations using the Database-Update command and seed
 it with the 'Seed' button that is on the home page of the application.
 The application is pretty straight forward I believe that once you started you will be 
 able to navigate through it very easily.
